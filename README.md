# DesignerFramework
Framework for SnowFlake Designer

## Getting Started

To install dependencies, run:

**npm install**

This pulls all the dependencies from package.json (that hopefully Preston remembered to add) and installs into your node_modules folder. Do not look in that folder it's a black hole. :)
